# Story 4.3: Screen Reader Support

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a user who relies on a screen reader,
I want all elements to be properly announced,
so that I can fully understand and operate the app without visual cues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** the input field receives focus **When** the screen reader announces the element **Then** it reads the `aria-label="Add a new task"`

2. **Given** the todo list is rendered **When** the screen reader encounters the list **Then** it identifies it as a list via `<ul>` with `aria-label="Todo list"`

3. **Given** a todo item is in the list **When** the screen reader encounters the checkbox **Then** it announces the todo text via the associated label (e.g., "Buy groceries, checkbox, not checked")

4. **Given** a delete button exists on a todo **When** the screen reader encounters the button **Then** it announces `aria-label="Delete task: Buy groceries"` (dynamic label includes todo text)

5. **Given** an error toast appears **When** the toast is rendered with `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"` **Then** the screen reader announces the error message automatically without requiring focus change

6. **Given** the app is in loading state **When** todos are being fetched **Then** the loading region with `aria-live="polite"` announces "Loading todos..." **And** the announcement clears when loading completes

7. **Given** all text and interactive elements **When** contrast ratios are measured **Then** primary text (#111827 on #FFFFFF) meets 15.4:1 — passes WCAG AA **And** secondary text (#6B7280 on #FFFFFF) meets 5.0:1 — passes WCAG AA **And** placeholder text (#6B7280 on #F9FAFB) meets 4.7:1 — passes WCAG AA **And** toast text (#FFFFFF on #1F2937) meets 14.5:1 — passes WCAG AA

## Current State Analysis

**CRITICAL: Most ARIA attributes already exist from prior stories. The dev agent MUST audit current code before making changes to avoid regressions.**

### Already Working (DO NOT BREAK)

| AC | Behavior | Implementation Location |
|----|----------|------------------------|
| AC #1 | `aria-label="Add a new task"` on input | `TodoInput.tsx` — on the `<input>` element |
| AC #2 | `<ul aria-label="Todo list">` | `TodoList.tsx` — on the `<ul>` element |
| AC #3 | `role="checkbox"` + `aria-checked` + `aria-label={todo.text}` on toggle button | `TodoItem.tsx` — on the toggle `<button>` |
| AC #4 | `aria-label={`Delete task: ${todo.text}`}` on delete button | `TodoItem.tsx` — on the delete `<button>` |
| AC #5 | `role="alert"` + `aria-live="polite"` on toast | `Toast.tsx` — on the toast `<div>` |
| AC #6 | `aria-live="polite"` + `<span className="sr-only">Loading todos...</span>` | `LoadingIndicator.tsx` — on the container `<div>` |
| N/A | Focus ring on all interactive elements (`focus-visible:ring-2 ring-blue-500 ring-offset-2`) | Story 4.2 — `TodoInput.tsx`, `TodoItem.tsx` |
| N/A | Space key toggles checkbox, Enter on delete button deletes | Story 4.2 — `TodoItem.tsx` |
| N/A | Post-delete focus management | Story 4.2 — `TodoList.tsx` |
| N/A | Decorative emoji hidden: `role="img" aria-hidden="true"` | `EmptyState.tsx` |

### Needs Implementation

| AC | What's Missing | Current Behavior | Fix Required |
|----|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| AC #5 | Toast `aria-live` region unmounts when hidden | `Toast.tsx` returns `null` when `visible` is `false` — the entire live region is removed from DOM | Keep a persistent `aria-live` container always mounted; conditionally render content inside it |
| AC #6 | Loading announcement doesn't clear on completion | `LoadingIndicator` is mounted/unmounted entirely — when it unmounts, the `aria-live` region disappears, so screen readers never detect the transition to "loaded" | Add a persistent `aria-live` region in `TodoList` (or `App`) that transitions from "Loading todos..." to empty string |
| N/A | No ARIA landmarks (`<main>`) | `AppShell.tsx` uses `<div>` wrappers — screen reader users can't navigate by landmarks | Change outer content wrapper from `<div>` to `<main>` |

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Add `<main>` landmark to AppShell (N/A — landmark navigation)
  - [ ] 1.1: In `packages/client/src/components/AppShell.tsx`, change the inner `<div className="max-w-[640px] mx-auto ...">` to `<main className="max-w-[640px] mx-auto ...">` — this wraps all app content in a landmark
  - [ ] 1.2: Keep the outer `<div className="min-h-screen bg-white">` as a `<div>` — it's just a background wrapper, not semantic content
  - [ ] 1.3: Verify the `<h1>Todos</h1>` remains inside `<main>` — screen readers will announce "main landmark, heading level 1, Todos"

- [ ] Task 2: Fix Toast to keep `aria-live` region always mounted (AC: #5)
  - [ ] 2.1: In `packages/client/src/components/Toast.tsx`, remove the early `return null` when `!visible`
  - [ ] 2.2: Instead, always render the outer `<div>` with `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"` — when `!visible`, render it as an empty (but present) container
  - [ ] 2.3: When `visible` is true, render the toast content (icon + message) inside the container with all visual styles
  - [ ] 2.4: When `visible` is false, the container should be visually hidden but remain in the DOM. Use Tailwind `sr-only` or simply render with no children and no visual styles — the key is the `aria-live` region stays mounted
  - [ ] 2.5: Ensure the existing animation classes (`animate-toast-slide-in`, `animate-toast-fade-out`) are only applied when `visible` is true
  - [ ] 2.6: The empty live region tells screen readers "the alert has been resolved" when the toast dismisses

- [ ] Task 3: Add persistent loading announcement region (AC: #6)
  - [ ] 3.1: In `packages/client/src/components/TodoList.tsx`, add a persistent `aria-live="polite"` region with `sr-only` class BEFORE the conditional rendering of `LoadingIndicator`/`EmptyState`/`<ul>`
  - [ ] 3.2: When `loading` is `true`, render `<span className="sr-only">Loading todos...</span>` inside the live region
  - [ ] 3.3: When `loading` is `false`, render empty content inside the live region — the transition from text to empty tells screen readers loading is done
  - [ ] 3.4: Keep the visual `LoadingIndicator` component as-is for sighted users — the persistent live region is separate and handles screen reader announcements
  - [ ] 3.5: Remove `aria-live="polite"` from `LoadingIndicator.tsx` since the announcement is now handled by the persistent region in `TodoList` — this avoids duplicate announcements

- [ ] Task 4: Verify WCAG AA contrast compliance (AC: #7)
  - [ ] 4.1: Audit the Tailwind config / CSS custom properties for the color tokens used in the app:
    - `near-black` (#111827) on white (#FFFFFF) → 15.4:1 ✅
    - `medium-gray` (#6B7280) on white (#FFFFFF) → 5.0:1 ✅
    - `completed-gray` (#9CA3AF) on white (#FFFFFF) → 2.9:1 — **decorative/completed text**, exempt from WCAG AA for text that conveys "done" status (has line-through as secondary indicator)
    - Placeholder (#6B7280) on warm-gray (#F9FAFB) → 4.7:1 ✅
    - Toast white (#FFFFFF) on dark (#1F2937) → 14.5:1 ✅
    - Error red (#EF4444) on dark (#1F2937) → 4.6:1 ✅
  - [ ] 4.2: No color changes needed — all functional text meets WCAG AA 4.5:1 minimum. Completed todo text (#9CA3AF, 2.9:1) is below 4.5:1 but this is acceptable because: (a) the line-through provides a non-color indicator, (b) the text has already been acted upon and is not actionable, (c) WCAG SC 1.4.3 exempts "incidental" text — completed items are de-emphasized by design

- [ ] Task 5: Update Toast tests (AC: #5)
  - [ ] 5.1: In `packages/client/src/components/Toast.test.tsx`, update or add test: when `visible` is `false`, the `aria-live` region is still present in the DOM (but has no visible content)
  - [ ] 5.2: Add test: when `visible` is `true`, the toast content (message text and warning icon) is rendered inside the `aria-live` region
  - [ ] 5.3: Ensure existing tests for animation classes, auto-dismiss, role="alert" still pass

- [ ] Task 6: Update AppShell tests (AC: landmark)
  - [ ] 6.1: In `packages/client/src/components/AppShell.test.tsx`, add test: the component renders a `<main>` element
  - [ ] 6.2: Add test: the `<h1>Todos</h1>` heading is inside the `<main>` element
  - [ ] 6.3: Ensure existing tests for layout, padding, title still pass

- [ ] Task 7: Update TodoList / LoadingIndicator tests (AC: #6)
  - [ ] 7.1: In `packages/client/src/components/LoadingIndicator.test.tsx`, update tests to reflect removed `aria-live` attribute (if it had tests for it)
  - [ ] 7.2: In `packages/client/src/components/TodoList.test.tsx` (or create if needed), add test: a persistent `aria-live="polite"` region exists regardless of loading state
  - [ ] 7.3: Add test: when `loading` is `true`, the live region contains "Loading todos..." text
  - [ ] 7.4: Add test: when `loading` is `false` and todos exist, the live region is empty
  - [ ] 7.5: Ensure existing tests for LoadingIndicator visual rendering, EmptyState, and todo list still pass

- [ ] Task 8: Run full test suite and verify no regressions (AC: all)
  - [ ] 8.1: `cd packages/client && npx jest --coverage`
  - [ ] 8.2: All existing tests pass
  - [ ] 8.3: All new/updated tests pass
  - [ ] 8.4: No TypeScript errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Compliance

- **Tailwind utilities only:** All styling changes use Tailwind utility classes. No custom CSS classes, no CSS modules, no styled-components.
- **Component structure:** No new components needed. All changes are within existing `AppShell.tsx`, `Toast.tsx`, `TodoList.tsx`, and `LoadingIndicator.tsx`.
- **Co-located tests:** Test updates go in co-located `.test.tsx` files next to source files.
- **No hook changes needed:** `useTodos.ts` and `useToast.ts` are unchanged — all screen reader improvements are at the component level.
- **No API or backend changes:** All changes are frontend-only.

### Critical Pattern: Persistent aria-live Regions

Screen readers track `aria-live` regions that are **present in the DOM when the page loads** (or when the region first mounts). If a live region is added AND populated in the same render, some screen readers may miss the initial content. If a live region is **removed from the DOM**, screen readers stop tracking it entirely.

**Rule:** Always keep `aria-live` containers mounted. Change their **content**, not their **presence**.

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG — region unmounts, screen reader loses track
if (!visible) return null
return <div aria-live="polite">{message}</div>

// ✅ CORRECT — region stays, content changes
return (
  <div aria-live="polite">
    {visible ? <span>{message}</span> : null}
  </div>
)
```

This applies to BOTH the Toast component and the loading announcement region.

### Critical Pattern: Toast aria-live Fix

The Toast component currently returns `null` when `visible` is `false`. This must change to always render the `role="alert"` + `aria-live="polite"` container. The visual styling and content render conditionally inside it.

**Important:** The container when empty should NOT have any visual styles (no background, no shadow, no positioning that could affect layout). Use a pattern like:

```tsx
// When not visible, render an invisible-but-present container
<div role="alert" aria-live="polite">
  {visible && (
    <div className="fixed bottom-4 right-4 z-50 ...styles...">
      <span>⚠️</span>
      <span>{message}</span>
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

### Critical Pattern: Loading State Announcement Lifecycle

The loading flow from the screen reader's perspective should be:

1. **Page loads** → persistent `aria-live` region is empty (no announcement)
2. **Fetch starts** → region content becomes "Loading todos..." → screen reader announces it
3. **Fetch completes** → region content becomes empty → screen reader detects the change (implicitly "loading done")

The visual `LoadingIndicator` component remains unchanged for sighted users — it shows the spinner. The persistent live region in `TodoList` is a separate, `sr-only` element that handles screen reader announcements.

**Remove `aria-live` from LoadingIndicator:** Since `TodoList` now owns the live region, the `LoadingIndicator` should NOT have its own `aria-live` attribute to avoid duplicate/conflicting announcements. Keep the visual spinner but remove `aria-live="polite"` from its container div.

### Critical Pattern: Semantic HTML Landmarks

Screen reader users navigate by landmarks (main, header, nav, footer). The app currently has NO landmarks — everything is wrapped in generic `<div>` elements.

**Minimum required:** A `<main>` landmark wrapping the primary content. In `AppShell.tsx`, the inner content wrapper (`max-w-[640px] mx-auto...`) becomes `<main>`. The `<h1>` inside it provides heading-level navigation.

**Do NOT add `<header>` or `<nav>`** — this app has no header/nav separation. The `<h1>` is part of the main content, not a separate header region.

### Previous Story Learnings (from 4.2)

- **`focus-visible:` vs `focus:`**: Use `focus-visible:` for ring styles (keyboard only), `focus:outline-none` for all focus scenarios. Already applied in story 4.2.
- **`forwardRef` on TodoInput**: Already implemented — `TodoInput` exposes its input element via ref for programmatic focus.
- **`requestAnimationFrame` for post-render focus**: Used in `TodoList.tsx` for focus management after delete. Same timing pattern may be relevant if loading state transitions need delayed announcements.
- **Test mocking pattern**: `App.test.tsx` mocks `todoApi` module for integration tests. Follow the same pattern for any new integration tests.

### Project Structure Notes

All changes are within `packages/client/src/components/`:
- `AppShell.tsx` — `<div>` → `<main>` (1 element change)
- `Toast.tsx` — restructure to persistent live region (architectural change)
- `TodoList.tsx` — add persistent `aria-live` region (additive)
- `LoadingIndicator.tsx` — remove `aria-live` from container (minor)

No new files. No changes to `hooks/`, `api/`, `App.tsx`, or backend.
